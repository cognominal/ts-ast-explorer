A config option `updateASTOnSaveOnly` : either allows to update the AST of the
current document on save, or do it continuously as the file is edited.

## randome stuff

for the README generated by yo code see [yo-README.md](yo-README.md). It
contains stuff true of all extensions generated by `yo code`.
[vsc-extension-quickstart.md](vsc-extension-quickstart.md) contains information
about developping and debugging the extension. I will probably delete the
formet and keep the latter for potential contributors.
